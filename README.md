## Movie and Tv show app

In this application you can search for movies by name on the front page. You can also see the trending movies and tv shows in two other pages. I've used an API to get the data and I've also been using MUI to help me build the look of the application.

## Navigation

### Home

- '/' (Home - This is where you can search for movies by name)
